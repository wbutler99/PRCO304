Project Vision:
I want to do a project surrounding retail systems, more specifically the systems used by individual shops that managers and shop staff use on a regular basis. I feel that retail systems have not evolved much over the last few years and I want to change that by creating a modern retail management system so that managers and shop staff can more effectively carry out their jobs with an easy to use system for handling things such as stock, transactions, ordering, deliveries and compliance. 
I want to do this project due to my previous experience in the industry a few years ago where I had to use a very old system that had been in place for around a decade that was not very user friendly and provided a poor user experience. I wish to modernise this type of system to make it more user friendly and more importantly more secure using the latest security measures as sensitive information is transferred on these systems.
I also wish to add on an interface for customers to use for a click and collect service for smaller shops to make it easier to see what a shop near to you has in stock to save customers journeys to shops only to find the shop doesn’t have the item they desired in stock or doesn’t sell the item in question. This will also allow the customer to see when an item will be back in stock if it is out of stock based off when deliveries with that item will be arriving. This is something I also experience during my time working in retail with questions being asked of me as to if something is in stock or if we sold certain items. This will then relieve stress off the staff in store and allow them to more effectively carry out their duties.
